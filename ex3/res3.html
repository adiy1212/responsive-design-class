			his piece was first published in September 2009 as part of our roundup of the 2000s. In it, author Nitsuh Abebe traces the slow encroachment of typically "indie" cultural touchstones and sensibilities into corners of mainstream advertising, film, television, and, of course, music. The fallout from this process-- recently evidenced by the Twilight: New Moon soundtrack to Grizzly Bear soundtracking a large Volkswagen ad campaign to Vampire Weekend hitting #1 on the Billboard album charts-- has created tension in some circles and has been embraced in others. As we concluded in September, this is a natural process and worth embracing-- moments of tension and doubt within nominally independent cultures often signal bursts of creative energy, inspiring new developments. --Ed.
			"I opened up the door, and much to my surprise
			The girls were wearing formals, and the boys were wearing ties
			And I feel that I should mention that the band was at attention
			They just stood there, oh so neat, while they played their swinging beat....
			It's been long overdue-- we've been needing something new--
			Sophisticated boom boom!
